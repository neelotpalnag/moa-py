The GP-DEMO algorithm is implemented as a part of the jMetal project (http://jmetal.sourceforge.net/) that includes a lot of algorithms.
The paramaters of the run, algorithm and the chosen optimization problem is set through the INPUT.txt
The program is run with run2.bat, so that the seed and various problems can be run with only one run.

The source code of the algorithm (and also all other algorithms) is in the source.zip
